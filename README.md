Are you a life-long learner? Are you haunted by multiple interests that barely communicate with one another? Above all else, are you interested in hearing the multiple life hacks and opinions of a jack of all trades, master of none? 

If so, welcome to **A Geek's Burrow**, a place where I lose track of my mind whilst I attempt to build an online presence. Here, you will find articles that cover a vast array of topics: from Computer Science to Literature, from language learning to philosophical reflections and even a bit of personal development here and there, you're bound to find a topic that resonates with you!

## üìù About the project
Before any lenghty explanations, I wanted to address the elephant in the room: if you are already familiar with GitHub terminology, you may have noticed that this repository sure has a lot of commits for something so empty. I had a lot worked on before I decided to start over and was, in fact, already working on the database and backend side of development. However, I have a lot of weaknesses in the frontend department and I wished to cover them before jumping into servers and database connection. If you are not a developer, that means that I wanted to make this blog pretty before it was functional.

**A Geek's Burrow** started off as a challenge from Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp, but I gave myself certain liberties - the challenge itself did not involve any database manipulation, for example. However, I wanted to have a place where I could gather all of my articles, since all of them had been in [Medium](https://medium.com/@herlocksholmes1888) until now.

[Here's the prototype I made on Figma!](https://www.figma.com/design/9JL3E20K2HAychTQUmxYea/A-Geek's-Burrow?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=CaF7cN6n1p4gTLb3-0). For those who have been here since the beginning, [here's the original design](https://www.figma.com/design/Xppsg76PikexYXjKSAtsQN/Geek's-Burrow?node-id=1-2&node-type=canvas&t=EST6BTrFXrmmE53q-0). Talk about a glow up.

## üíæ Let's get technical
Here's the technologies that make **A Geek's Burrow** run:

* EJS and HTML, for the skeleton of the website;
* CSS, so it is actually appealing to look at. I plan on using Tailwind once I get to the styling part, even if I prefer the liberty of plain CSS. TODO: edit this part of the README if I actually go through with this idea;
* JavaScript, NodeJS and Express, for all of the pesky programming part;
* Either PostgreSQL or MongoDB. I haven't decided yet, but I'm leaning more towards MongoDB since this blog will only have one user to keep track of and I can't think of many relationships between the articles.
